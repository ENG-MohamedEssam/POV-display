# POV-display
## Abstract
#### A POV (persistence of vision) display clock is a type of electronic display that uses LEDs to create the illusion of a moving image. In this case, it uses LEDs to represent an analog clock.

#### The system uses an Atmega32 microcontroller, which is a popular choice for embedded systems due to its low power consumption, high processing power and large number of I/O pins.

#### The driver code is responsible for controlling the LEDs, which are connected to the microcontroller's I/O pins. This code is responsible for turning the LEDs on and off at the appropriate times to create the illusion of a moving clock hand.

#### The algorithm is responsible for calculating the position of the clock hands based on the current time. It uses a combination of math and timing functions to determine the position of the hands and then sends the corresponding commands to the driver code to control the LEDs.

#### The project was developed by a team, and it's likely that the team divided the work and each member was responsible for a different part of the project. With this project, the team was able to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a complete embedded systems project, including writing code for both the microcontroller and the algorithm, as well as debugging and testing the system.
